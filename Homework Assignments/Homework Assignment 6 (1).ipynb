    "# Homework Assignment 6 - Evan Callaghan\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. A data scientist is running an AdaBoost classifier on a dataset with 100 observations. Answer the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "### a) What is the weight initial weight of observation 72th in the training dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Initially, an AdaBoost classifier weighs all observations equally. Since there is 100 observations under consideration, the initial weight of the 72nd observation is 1/100 (0.01). \n",
    "\n",
    "### b) The 72nd observation in the training dataset is misclassified by the first weak learner chosen by the data scientist. Is the new weight of the 72nd observation in the training dataset larger or smaller than the weight assigned to that observation initially?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### AdaBoost works to increase the weight of misclassified observations in order to force the learner to focus on the regions that were more problematic for the previous estimators. Therefore, since the 72nd observation is misclassified by the first learner, the new weight will be larger than the weight initially assigned. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Explain why AbaBoost.M1 is an ensemble learning algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### An ensemble learning algorithm is defined as a set of weak learners that are trained together (or in a sequence) to make up a committee. In classification and regression problems, the final result is obtained by averaging the predictions or employing a majority vote. In AdaBoost.M1, a set number of weak models are added sequentially and trained using the weighted training data. Therefore, AdaBoost.M1 is an ensemble learning algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Suppose you are running AdaBoost.M1 (with Î· = 0.1) with 4 training examples. At the start of the current iteration, the four examples have the weights shown in the following table. Another column says if the weak classifier got them correct or incorrect. Determining the new weights for these four examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### w(t) = [0.16, 0.64, 0.08, 0.12], eta = 0.1, o1 = -1, o2 = -1, o3 = 1, o4 = 1,\n",
    "#### E(t) = (0.08 + 0.12) / (0.16 + 0.64 + 0.08 + 0.12) = 0.2\n",
    "#### alpha(t) = log((1 - E(t)) / E(t)) = log((1 - 0.2) / 0.2) = 0.60206\n",
    "\n",
    "#### w1(t+1) = w1(t)e^(eta * alpha(t) * o1) = 0.16e^(0.1 * 0.60206 * -1) = 0.15065\n",
    "#### w2(t+1) = w2(t)e^(eta * alpha(t) * o2) = 0.64e^(0.1 * 0.60206 * -1) = 0.60261\n",
    "#### w3(t+1) = w3(t)e^(eta * alpha(t) * o3) = 0.08e^(0.1 * 0.60206 * 1) = 0.08496\n",
    "#### w4(t+1) = w4(t)e^(eta * alpha(t) * o4) = 0.12e^(0.1 * 0.60206 * 1) = 0.12745\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Normalized: w(t+1) = [0.156, 0.624, 0.088, 0.132]\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.  If your AdaBoost ensemble under-fits the training dataset, what would you do to fix that? That is, which hyper-parameters should you tweak?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### If your AdaBoost ensemble under-fits the training dataset, I would try to increase the number of estimators or reduce the regularization hyper-parameter of the base estimator. These options could increase the complexity of the model and avoid the problem of under-fitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. For binary classification, which of the following statements are TRUE of AdaBoost with decision trees as learners?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A. It usually has lower bias than a single decision tree.\n",
    "#### B. It is popular because it usually works well even before any hyper-parameter tuning \n",
    "#### C. It assigns higher weights to observations that have been misclassified."
