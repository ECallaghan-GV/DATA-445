    "## 4. Explain what regularization is and why it is useful.\n",
    "#### Regularization is a method of regression that involves fitting a model using all input variables and the estimated coefficients being regularized/shrunken towards zero relative to their least squares estimates. It is useful because, effectively, regularization reduces the variance in predictions and protects against over-fitting in the model. \n",
